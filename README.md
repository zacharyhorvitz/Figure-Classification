# Figure-Classification
Caffe Deep Learning for Scientific Figure Classification

This repository contains 2 directories, one for a binary (line vs. all other types) classification, and one for a 7 category classification.

INSTALLATION: http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html
CONFIGURATION TUTORIAL: http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/gathered/examples/imagenet.html

The net is a convolutional neural net (CNN) based on the 2012 Nips Paper by Krizhevsky et al. 


TO DO:
-This will contain the trained caffemodels and solverstates, in the respective directories

-This will contain the c++ programm for scraping the csv files
-This will contain the results from halving the dataset to see its impact on the data
-This will contain a readme for running using the nets for training, testing, and classification purposes
